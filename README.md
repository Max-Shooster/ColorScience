# Color Science
MATLAB projects that involve analysis of the physical sources of color, the visual mechanisms that provide our experience of color, 
and the descriptive systems that have been developed for relating the physical and visual properties for practical methods for measuring,
modeling, and controlling color in digital imaging systems.
